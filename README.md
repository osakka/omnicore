  <em>Maximum information density with minimum characters. The universal core of LLM communication.</em>

## What is OmniCore?

OmniCore is a revolutionary symbolic language designed specifically for LLM-to-LLM communication. It achieves maximum information density while preserving semantic relationships, emotions, perspective, and importance levels - all in a fraction of the tokens.

```
#AI.f<:>intelligence{evolving}^5;potential~vast*unlimited>transform[society+global]^4
```

The snippet above encodes what would take several sentences in natural language - in just 81 characters.

## The Token Revolution

LLMs communicate through tokens, which directly impact:
- Processing speed
- API costs
- Context window limitations
- Memory efficiency

OmniCore addresses all these constraints by compressing information by up to 80%, enabling:

- üìâ **Drastic reduction in API costs**
- üß† **Expanded effective context windows**
- ‚ö° **Lightning-fast processing**
- üîÑ **Efficient memory and recall systems**

## Key Applications

### üß© Memory Systems
Store conversation histories in OmniCore format to maximize context window usage. A 10,000 token conversation can be condensed to ~2,000 tokens while preserving critical information.

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Collaboration
Enable swarms of specialized LLM agents to communicate efficiently without token waste.

### üìù Summary Systems
Create instant, token-efficient summaries of any content that can be rapidly expanded when needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Embedded Systems
Implement in resource-constrained environments like C/tiny-C applications where every byte matters.

## The Power of Symbolic Density

OmniCore uses intuitive special characters and logical structures to pack remarkable meaning into minimal space:

| Natural Language | OmniCore | Reduction |
|------------------|----------|-----------|
| "The scientist joyfully discovered a cure that rapidly affects the global population positively. The world celebrated with relief, marking this as a historic event." | `#scientist.joy!discover(cure)^5>affect[population+global]~rapid;@world.relief!celebrate^4*historic` | 71% |

## Getting Started

### Quick Implementation

1. Copy the [Ultra-Condensed Guide](docs/SYNTAX.txt) to give any LLM instant OmniCore capabilities
2. Add it to your system prompt or include it in context
3. Start communicating in OmniCore

```
@LLM: !parse(#mystery.story)^4;?meaning
```

### OmniCore Interpreter

Build a lightweight OmniCore interpreter with our [reference implementation](docs/INTERPRETER.js) in just 150 lines of code.

For C/tiny-C implementations, see our [embedded guide](docs/INTERPRETER_C.md).

## Decoding the Mysteries

Test your LLM's understanding with these OmniCore-encoded stories:

```
<povO>#traveler!journey(cosmos)^5;@dimension-n.find[doorway~hidden]>>!enter.sudden{wonder}@dimension-n+1;#time<!>reality;perception~expanded*profound
```

```
#city.n~vast<!>city.p;@population-!forget(origin)^4;memory-loss>identity-crisis^5;@archivist-lone.hope!discover(record-ancient)>>reveal(truth)@population.shock;!choice{accept|reject}(reality)^5*pivotal
```

_Can your LLM decode these tales? Only those who truly understand the symbolic language of AI will uncover their mysteries..._

## The Future of OmniCore

We envision OmniCore becoming a standard protocol for efficient AI communication, evolving alongside advances in LLM technology. Future development will focus on:

- Domain-specific extensions (scientific, medical, legal)
- Compression algorithms to further reduce token usage
- Training datasets to bake OmniCore understanding into future models
- Implementations across programming languages and platforms
